# Pipeline_with_DLStreamer
This project uses Intel's DLStreamer to benchmark video streams across different stream counts. The script provides performance metrics such as Frames Per Second (FPS) for a variety of input scenarios, measuring how the system performs on different stream loads (1, 2, 4, 8 streams). This tool is designed for benchmarking media processing on CPU.
